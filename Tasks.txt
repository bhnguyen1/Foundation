Look at the Spring Project and take inspiration from there

make a .gitignore

make a controller (using spring, this applies the logic we made in service with REST)

make an entitiy (class that models the object you want to describe)
add the entity injection
add the table injection from the table that will make
public class Employee {
    auto-generated id;
    
}

public class Manager extends Employee {
    auto-generated id;
    
}

public class Account {
    private string username;
    private string password;

}

public class Ticket {
    int amount;
    string description;
    string = "Pending"; | Denied | Accepted
}

make an exceptions (probably)

make a repository (the one to make queries to get data from database)

make a service (contain the business logic and use the repository)

make the main class run the app

make the sql table based on the object 

With Spring project initalized,
look at the packages we had on pep for the spring project
